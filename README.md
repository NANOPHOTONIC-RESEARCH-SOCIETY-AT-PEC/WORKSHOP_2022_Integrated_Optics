Integrated optics is a technology which aims at constructing so-called¬†integrated optical devices¬†or¬†photonic integrated circuits¬†or¬†planar light wave circuits, containing several or many optical components which are combined  to perform a wide variety of optical functions. Recent developments in nanostructures, metamaterials, and silicon technologies have expanded the range of possible functionalities of optical devices on highly integrated chips. Photonic integrated circuits  have the ability to perform all the operations with light as the quintessential factor. Photonics has high potential of development, but it needs a thorough scientific research to perform light manipulation for all operations. Because of its limitless potential, Photonics find its application in on chip communication, healthcare diagnostics, processing industry, mobility, safety and security, and agro-food etc.
With focus on advancements in integrated optics, will focus on latest research trends on integrated optics, optoelectronics and nano-photonics from the experts of both academia and industry who will be showing their latest technical results, and showcase their products and services.
